# Operating System Fundamentals

OS is interface between user and hardware here interface is system software (tested programs + documentation) 

Their are two types of Interfaces :

1. Graphical User Interface (System Call) : Access files and folder through images and icons
2. Character User Interface (System Command) : Acces files and folder through commands

Software are of two types - Application and System Software

1. Application Software : They are designed for some special task. Example VLC , Photo Album.This types of softwares are usually written in high level languages like Java,Python
2. System Software: System software operates the computer hardware or provides a platform to run application software.They are more near to hardware thatâ€™s they are written in low level langauges like Assembly Language or Machine Code. Examples include OS and Debugger.

## Examples of Operating System

1. Windows
2. Linux
3. MacOS
4. Android
5. IOS

## Difference between High Level and Low Level Language ?

1. Low Level Language : Low level are more closer to harware are more efficent but harder to user
2. High Level Language : Hight level langauge is more closer to human beings , easy to use and provide higher level of abstraction from the hardware  

The OS acts as an interface between the user and the hardware. It provides two types of interfaces: Graphical User Interface and Character User Interface. The OS makes it easier to access the computer hardware without having to worry about the internal details. The software that contains the core component of OS is called kernel. The primary functions of the OS are resource management, processor management, memory management, I/O management, security, and protection. The goal of the OS is to be user-friendly and efficient.

1. System Software : System software operates the computer hardware or provide platform to run application software. Example OS, Debugger etc

So we can directly access the computer hardware and make our thing works but the interface in this case, OS makes our work easier , user dont have to worry about internal details

Functions of Operating System

1. Resource Manager
2. Processor Management
3. Memory Management
4. I/O Management
5. Security and Protection

Goal of Operating System

1. Conveneince : User Friendly and Open to Use 
2. Efficent 

## Types of Operating System

1. Batch OS :
